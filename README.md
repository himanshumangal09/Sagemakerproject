# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project built with SageMaker using XGBoost.I built a positive - negative Sentiment   classifier on AWS Sagemaker.I made a web page that interacts with deployed endpoints and gives the output using AWS Lambda.
